# MiniChecklist
Callable Checklist tool to not forget a certain thing

This mini tool doesn't aim to manage huge amounts of checklists or to write checklists in a fancy way.
It just reads a textfile and displays each line as a button to be checked if the task is done

Finished tasks can also be hidden.

The pictures above are based on the following textfile (which is also included to resoureces
# 
``` text
Some Task
Some other Task
Some important Task!
And also this
Don't forget also ...
And Finish Last one!
```

# Calling with command-line argument
You can call this tool by passing target text-file which will be displayed directly after start
This also comes in handy if you would like to manage your checklists otherwise.

# Technical Info

# ToDo
Several improvements are to be done (and could be added soon)
- Hints as tooltip or details view to each task
- Special accentuation of important (or as important signed) tasks
